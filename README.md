# Bank-Loan-Analytics-Power-BI-Project

## Project Overview

The project aims to leverage Power BI to analyse and visualize bank loan data effectively, enabling data-driven decision-making. By creating interactive dashboards and detailed reports, the project will help to understand key trends, identify risks and optimize loan-related processes.

## Data

1.	Customer Information: Age, address, annual income, credits and employment details.
   
2.	Loan Details: Loan amount, interest rate, instalments loan type, and purpose.
   
3.	Repayment Data: Payment history, details etc.
   
4.	Geographical Data: Location of customers and distribution of loans.

## Key Features

1.	Total Loan Applications: For calculating the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
   
2.	Total Funded Amount: For calculating the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
   
3.	Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment.
   
4.	Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates.
   
5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers helps us gauge the financial health. 

6.	Monthly Trends by Issue Date :  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
   
7.	Regional Analysis by State : To identify regions with significant lending activity.
   
8.	Loan Purpose Breakdown : Provides a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans.
   
9.	Loan Term Analysis : To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
